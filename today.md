food review
Ordered the enchilada combination and a bowl of corn chowder soup.
Server was good.
Food was lame.
Corn chowder tasted like undercooked corn bread and had the same texture.  But it was better than the main course.
Pork enchilada was sweet like Sweet Baby Rays barbeque sauce.  Chicken was completely tasteless, also smothered in bbq sauce.  Cheese was flavorless.  Ground beef was very herbal, not bad by itself, and beef enchilada sauce was more savory and when combined it was very unusual and disturbing.  Rice and beans were bland beyond identification.  
I, personally, was extremely hungry.  The chips and salsa were okay, not better than some jarred stuff from the grocery store.

Originally I thought this meal would be a 6/10 simply because I was not appalled to eat it, however, after further thinking it was upsettingly disappointing especially considering there are about 4 places in Holly to eat at all.  4/10.  Suffice to say, despite this being my second time at the establishment and concerning the frequency in which I am in the area, I am greatly emboldened to pack a lunch when visiting Holly.  Price was similar to other Mexican restaurants despite being some of the lowest quality of any restaurant.
