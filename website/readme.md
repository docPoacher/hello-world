Internet is awful.  I want to blame the trees but ISP says they are doing work in the area.  I can barely study since my entire class is online and only loads up small fragments at a time.  Will keep at it, almost 1/5 through this class.

I find myself thinking about people groups.  I was alerted that people from middle eastern groups often do not provide me with the information needed to complete their transaction.  They do not seem to know that information either.  People from the African-American community usually try to give me an abundant amount of information, and other groups seem to wait for me to ask them.  Perhaps stereotypical european stock American people might wait to be told what I need, which is similar to how the middle eastern people operate, but not consistent as.  

Meaningless. I need to carry more notes.  I have decided to write a thesis on efficiency.  
 
Notes so far:  
### Methods for improving efficiency and making large workloads more manageable  
1. Don't reopen. Do multiple things.
    - If multiple tasks are required, finish them when the location is convenient
    - Don't leave the kitchen without something
2. Always have notes
    - If you have a thought, do not flesh it out without writing at least some of it out.  A sleeper is better than a drifter. (<--- sleeper thought right there)
3. 

## Using AI as a tutor or study tool
I watched a video a while which notably was not a good video but it posed an excellent concept from an Oxford study.  Some oxford professor teaches their students to use [AI] to tutor them on subjects to help develop a fuller understanding.  This seems no brainer but I am surprised I have not thought about it before.  I have used AI for discovering and testing ideas but never for helping me understand a concept I struggle with.  

My prejudice against this activity would classify any and all information disseminated from AI as strongly misinformed or outright lie.  However, this approach seems like it would test me on my misinformed stance.  Let us consider one example first.  

### The Socratic Method and AI
I posed the following question to ChatGPT (whatever the free version is after singing in with google):  


I prompted this following question to Copilot:  
`using the socratic method, help me understand how vector math can be simpler for measuring distance and other things than using geometric  shapes`  


  I was surprised
