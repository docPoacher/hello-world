<summary>There are only two possible explanations as to how life arose:... - George Wald</summary>
There are only two possible explanations as to how life arose: Spontaneous generation arising to evolution or a supernatural creative act of God.... There is no other possibility. Spontaneous generation was scientifically disproved 120 years ago by Louis Pasteur and others, but that just leaves us with only one other possibility... that life came as a supernatural act of creation by God, but I can't accept that philosophy because I do not want to believe in God. Therefore I choose to believe in that which I know is scientifically impossible, spontaneous generation leading to evolution.

  <summary>God as Author of life would then no longer be needed. (Dubos 1950, pp. 395–396)</summary>
  This is why the problem of spontaneous generation
is all absorbing, and all-important. It is the very
problem of life and of its origin. To bring about
spontaneous generation would be to create a germ. It
would be creating life; it would be to solve the problem
of its origin. It would mean to go from matter to life
through conditions of environment and of matter.
God as Author of life would then no longer be needed.
Matter would replace Him. God would need to be
invoked only as Author of the motions of the universe.
  (Dubos 1950, pp. 395–396)
