Tung nut and bitter gourd have α-Eleostearic acid.  This acid is unsaturated and in rats has been oberved to be converted to a conjugated linoleic acid that can trigger fat cell death and reduce cancer risk even in insignificant quantities (<1% diet).  
α-Eleostearic acid is what gives Tung oil its semi drying quality  

# Olive oil
Olive oil is a dietary fat that has a seemingly infinite shelf life.  

Composition:
### Saturated fats
 - Palmitic Acid = 13%
 - Stearic Acid = 1.5%
### Unsaturated fats
 Mono
 - Oleic Acid = 70%
 - Palmitoleic Acid = .3-3.5%
 Poly
 - Linoleic acid = 15%
 - α-Linolenic acid = 0.5%
### Smoke point
 - 410°F

Olive oil can be used to create semi-conductors for quantum computing.
