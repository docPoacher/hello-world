
There is something keeping me from enjoying this

There might be   someone behind the scenes

It's not what I want or asked for

It's not all I can believe

Unless you count shutting my mouth

Unless you count being docile


I couldn't complain it's not like I'm lame

It's all my fault.  It's all my fault.

I didn't choose how I take??? the abuse

It's all my fault.  It's all my fault.

Now I sling my guitar while I'm singing the blues

It's all my fault.  It's all my fault.

But I'm not insane I and I won't stay the same.



We all like to pretend we are spectacles

24 hour satellite coverage

I'm so exciting when I fry some eggs

It'll bring more viewers if I break my legs

I'm competing with 8 billion

that's 8 thousand million


(refrain)


That guy needs to get his act together

The dentist can help make his food taste better

All these people better off than me

All of these free from my hypocrisy

What makes me so different?

What makes me so different?


(refrain)


I'll wake up in the mirror

I'll sleep alert in dreams

My checklist will be checked

My bill won't go collect


I hope it won't be easy

I hope I really change

People remember tragedy

People learn from the pain

Can I learn from pain?
