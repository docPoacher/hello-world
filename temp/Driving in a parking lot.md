Driving in a parking lot

Lost again in the glare

Trying hard to let it go

I bite my lip to keep my stare


It's times like these I wonder

If I was made for a different life

Visions from a cemetery

Awake me in the night

Visions from a cemetery


Loss of detail in my periphery

My spine stiff in my neck

It's getting hard to keep my focus

I want to wind it all back


Back to the cemetery

Would be far enough

(it)  Would be far enough


#Refrain


It's times like these I wonder

If I was made for a different life

Visions from a cemetery

Awake me in the night


I want to be more imaginary

A lot less make believe

I want to stick a knife into it

I want my hands to lead


In a swamp of sweat and blood

Woke up right after I fell



I find it hard to tell ??


One day I'll be back at that cemetery

I'll be alone in the dark

Again I'll be in a parking lot

There are no hands on the clock


Does it concern the creative process

Does it really have to bleed

When do the fragments make a whole

Because I want do I also need?
