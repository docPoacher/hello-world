Enter in the back door

And trip over some shoes

My roommates getting messy

They tell me what's the use.


Voices I start hearing

The feeling settles in

Round the corner leering

Is my intervention

	in-ter-ven-tion


Darling take a seat

Take off your shoes, for feet must ache

This is your intervention, we came without contention

Something's gotta break.


Mom asks how I'm feeling

A knee jerk "I'm okay"

My dad is in the corner

Like he's trying to get away


It's nice to see aunt Helen

Been so long since we last meet

Bill won't you say something?

So dad say "When do we eat?"


I'm looking round the room

Who are these people here?

They tell me that they love me

And they want to set me straight


Vision's getting foggy

The smell of drying paint

My sub is getting soggy

I think I'm gonna faint.
