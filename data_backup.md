Most hoarders are going to backup only the most precious stuff to the cloud, a TB or two. A few will go with unlimited - Google Drive was a thing but they're cracking down. Several other unlimiteds died.  
If you go with a cheap, "unlimited" service, it won't be reliable, except maybe Backblaze Backup, which covers only local, connected drives (yeah, yeah, there are some tricks, but that's the basic rule).  
You are better off with an 18TB WD EasyStore from BestBuy for $249.99 (at this moment), write an encrypted backup to it and keep it offsite with a friend, relative or workplace. Better yet, buy two and rotate them. Veeam Agent for Windows Free is good for that.
