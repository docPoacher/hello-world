1986	Dragon Quest	Trend setter for Pure-Adventure JRPG.  Great Music, straightforward adventure style quest, very little customization.

1987	Final Fantasy	Pure-Adventure Helped to cement existing JRPG stereotypes.  Excellent and industry setting music established.
JRPG Elements: multiple party combinations, equipment management, leveling up.

Dragon Quest II		Does everything the first one does but better and longer.  One of the greatest soundtracks of all time.

1988	Final Fantasy II  Pure-er Adventure.  Established large sweeping narrative as a standard for Final Fantasy games.  This mostly solidified the style of narrative for future Final Fantasy games along with.  


1990	Final Fantasy III	Added a bunch of RPG elements that would be removed next, like job system.

1991	Final Fantasy IV	Probably the first "finished" Final Fantasy.  It holds up as a start to finish playable adventure.  All RPG elements are removed other than choosing equipment and leveling up.  Jobs predefined.

1992	Final Fantasy V		Added a bunch of RPG elements that would be removed next.  Job system again.
1993
1994	Final Fantasy VI	Party reduced down to 3 members.  Mood grows dark.  Steampunk elements become more prominent.  The formula of narrative is expanded to more closely follow the classic styles of storytelling such as German Heroic Legends.  The JRPG formula is strictly adhered to.  RPG elements include various party selections, customized spell lists (though they end up being maxed out), very very little story choices that affect something later.
1995
1996
1997	Final Fantasy VII	Mood grows darker and more steampunky.  More German hero stories.  Customization is almost identical to VI.
1998
1999	Final Fantasy VIII	Excessively complicated battle system elements enter in.  Fantasy elements replaced with weird early 20th century world.  Enemies scale with character level.  Backgrounds are for some reason rendered on a Kyocera flip phone screen.  Story becomes romantic.  I guess we had to include the French now.

2000	Final Fantasy IX	The idyllic Final Fantasy game.  Fantasy setting reintroduced.  Each character type is included, no job system, unnecessary and aggravating weird gem system that forces you into menus for half the game.  Extremely robust soundtrack.  Airship battle.  

2001	Final Fantasy X  Extreme derivative from all formula.  group is back to three but they can be swapped during battle so most of the battle is swapping to min/max.  Main gameplay focuses more on talking to random people and revisiting them 100 times.  Theme is futuristic hymalaian religion, very disjointed for the purpose of narrative.  

2002	Final Fantasy XI  No comment
2003	Final Fantasy X-2  Better than X, but more just because it is more fun to play.
2004
2005
2006	Final Fantasy XII  no comment

2009	Final Fantasy XIII Aweful.  Its basically a long movie where you occasionally hit a button.  I've heard that the meta is overwhelmingly sophisticated.

2010	Final Fantasy XIV (2010)  Online mashup of all final fantasy stuff.  Incredibly popular and you can do fun stuff like be a car.

2016	Final Fantasy XV United States South West camping simulator.  Story is unimportant because fishing and camping is the real pleasure.
