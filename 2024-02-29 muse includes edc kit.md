# Emotionally strained  
I feel that I am mentally disengaged.  I feel good physically, save the balls of my feet for whatever reason, and I believe I am getting enough sleep.  

However, I am finding it difficult to make music and difficult to become excited.  I am not 'dead' only a little low.

- lists the following things for caving pack
### Underground Urban Exploration Caving complete kit
Backpack
  - Rugged probably ballistic nylon.  "web pack" from army store
Items in backpack:
Firstaid
  - Doesn't mention what.  I'd assume a good first aid kit would be:
    - bandaids
    - pain-killer (probably ibeuprophin because it is not an anti-coagulant but aspirin maybe, anacin?)
    - anti-biotic oitment
    - alchohol wipes
    - tape and gauze
    - antihistamine
    - compression wrap
    - icey hot?
Flashlight
  - Probably should have multiple sources of light incase one breaks.  Headlamp is mentioned
Compass
  - good for direction even underground
Helmet
  - urban areas have rusty pokey bits everywhere
Helmet light - see flashlight above
Cameras
  - good for quick shots.  maybe have night vision.  Maybe headcam.  maybe with flashlight or with an attachment.
  - Audio recorder - for recording songs in the dark
  - Batteries - for flashlights and electronics duh
  - Knee and elbowpads - for crawling
  - Gloves - MUST i guess.  I dunno what to make them out of maybe some of those teflon gloves.
  - Hiking Boots - Walmart?
  - Extra Socks - keep your feet dry and change them.  If you get wet on the way in youll get wet on the way out.
  - Wading Boots - i suppose you would have to know that you would need them ahead of time.
  - Poisonous Gas Detector - wonderful
  - Journal / Sketchpad - Like indian jones XP dont forget writing impliment
  - Measuring tape - or rope of a specified length or marked every foot or yard.  Laser levels might be worthwhile also useful at home.  Laser measurers might need a reflective surface for accurate data
  - Rope - doubles as measuring tape.  I have some good stuff already.  Its slick, though.  Maybe hard to climb and definitely not strong enough for safety
  - Chalk - ORDER SOME ALREADY WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU.  They have flourescent and glow in the dark varieties.
  - Plastic bags.  Ziplock should be water proof.  Put your electronics in it if in a wet area.  Put ur food in it, too.
  - Swiss Army Knife - Knive is obvious, however, if this is true urban exploring you will probably want some crazy stuff like screw drivers, snips, maybe a wrench, pliers
