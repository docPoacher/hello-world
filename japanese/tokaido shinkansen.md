The Hikari is the second fastest train category along the Tokaido Shinkansen, serving a few more stations than the Nozomi and requiring about three hours to reach Shin-Osaka from Tokyo. There are two departures per hour in each direction, one operating between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka and the other between Tokyo and Okayama on the Sanyo Shinkansen.

Like the Mizuho, the Sakura operates between Shin-Osaka and Kagoshima-Chuo Station on the Kyushu Shinkansen, but stops at a few more stations than the Mizuho. Green Car seats make up only half of car number 6, while reserved seating comes in rows of 2x2 seats, which are almost as comfortable as the Green Car seats. Non-reserved seats come in rows of 3x2 seats.
