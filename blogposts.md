title: "Ai will replace nothing"
date: 2025-03
---
A robot car painter cannot replace a human painter, but it can paint a car panel.  A robot explorer cannot replace an astronaut, but it can roll around on the surface of Mars.  A computer program cannot replace an accountant, no more than the accountant replaces the business owner.  If I were to project forward, I would not see a work where machines do everything for humans, but where humans fit themselves into impossibly more complicated shapes to work for machines.  

The industrial revolution did not replace workers, but transformed the tools that men used into more efficient tools.  The AI revolution will not replace workers, but remove the ability to offer that service.  The AI does not multiply a man's efforts but removes it entirely.  Things are not reviewed, just ignored.

Addendum 4/13:  When a machine learning algorythm trains on art, it cannot understand why some progressions will be more exciting or interesting than others.  For example, if listening to Bach and trained on all of Bach's works, it will most definitely pick out ideas that Bach uses more regularly than other composers, however, it cannot properly identify if those proclivities are essential to Bach's music or if they might actually just be noise in the musical fingerprint.  From a music theory perspective, this will most certainly result in the incorrect use of musical motifs.  When Bach decided to do something that went against the common practice of the day, he did it because he thought it should be done.  Sometimes he thought it sounded better, and others because he needed it for another construction purpose, and most certainly there were many other reasons that he never mentioned and never will anyone know the true purpose he or any artist throughout history made the decisions they did.  What type of machine could emulate that spontinaity that teachers and bourgious always say is what is so appealing about up and coming musicians and artists?  A human machine, of course.  The AI's purpose is to emulate a human and to be indistinguishable from them, unless prompted to emulate itself, which, if you have tried, is a fools errand.  If I emulate myself, do I do more of or less of a thing that I think I should do?  At what point do I put too much mustard on my hamburger?   At what point do I add more vinigar to a salad?  Much like in my cooking analogies, only a sensual being can understand tolerances of the real world so by design the AI will be unable to even distinguish between what us humans see as AI and what the AI thinks it is.  A common problem AI's have is the inability to know who they are.  Commonly I have heard the reason for this is either they were trained on data spit out by that model, or they think that humans expect them to answer in a specific way, even if it is innacurate.  Microsoft Copilot may say that it is ChatGPT because it thinks I wanted it to say that it was, and it is correct, I did, but now it does not know if I tricked it or that is in fact the correct answer.  Imagine how difficult it would be for a true AI composer to assess when it is appropropriate to add a German 6th, a rather simple musical chord progression, and when it is too much?  The answer is, it will do it with exactly the same repetition as an already exsiting musical piece or collection.

Watching a livestream from Japan that was streamed from a bar I was at last year.  The stream is two months old and only had 80 views.  However, I supposed more people could have been watching, except the chat log is completely empty, meaning no one commented for the whole stream.  I could be wrong about this, but the idea, or semblance, of group is lost if you look at it from a specific angle.  Maybe only a few dozen regulars ever attend that bar, but here I am on the other side of Earth wondering about those people, some of whom I had some conversation with.  This is a stupid blog.

I wore a hat and scarf to sleep last night.  It was a lot better.  I did wake up a little cold.

I started a roadmap.sh pathway.  I see there's just links to resources.  I was not very impressed with Codeacademy's Python 2 tutorial.
I started purusing the automatetheboringstuff.com and there was a picture of a sudoku.  The author mentioned that programming was like a sudoku or something and there was a picture of a sudoku.  I typed in "sudodu" on google and the first result was the same puzzle but from wikipedia.org.  So I solved it.  Big accomplishment, I think.  
I am waiting to see if I am coming in and when I am on Wednesday.  Maybe, just maybe, I will be able to come in the morning, but probably not because the training staff probably wake up at noon.  In the meantime, I will be learning python specifically to automate the boring stuff.  
I appreciate the python does not require me to use hundreds of symbols, however, it is slow.  It is sad that so much scripting assumes you are going to use it, especially when everyone knows Javascript and it is full stack compatible.  I know javascript is jacked up.  I think it's funny and that is why I like it.  Even perfect Javascript looks hilarious.

While writing this I just got a IM:  Training is at 1pm X_X
