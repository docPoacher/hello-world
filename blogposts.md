title: "fill the silence"
date: 2025-04-14

Recap: a week and a half ago I watched the Eddy Burbank video where he locks his smart phone in a safe for a month and adopts a pre-911 lifestyle.  He gets a chorded landline with answering machine, prints maps off the computer, and uses the bus, among other things.  This reminded me that tech pushes my life rather than me using tech to do the thing I want to do.  There are many things I would not be able to do without tech, but unfortunately the big tech black hole requires a blood sacrifice and that is my blood.  I tried going without watching any video on my phone for a week and it was pretty nice, but actually some things stood out pretty noticably.

First, I spent a lot of extra time waiting and in silence.  Living with another person, I find myself waiting for them.  This made me wonder how often they wait for me.  Often I will be writing an email or a text to someone and they will ask me "What are you doing?"  This is kind of annoying because it should be expected that I respond in a timely manner to messages but also my attention is being mismanaged somehow, even during the test when I was not carrying my phone around but leaving it next to my computer.  I found that leaving it here not only helpped me compartmentalize but kept me from doing any social media.  I still watched a few video's on the computer but mostly I escaped.  

There is a nagging need to connect to people and many people will not connect with you even with a smartphone.  I wrote a song about this and I think maybe I should just become a hermit or join a monastary, but one that is more like just a club because monkery is not Christian, even though the Far eastern orthodox church started monkery and then it became hinduism and buddhism and then zen as it moved east and I wish I could say those movements had Christian roots but unfortunately they are ultimately false religions that ensnare billions of people in a class locked slave system.

I was watching a video from Cary the Snail about only using the library and he mentions that the constant need to fill the silence is sort of a mainstay for our modern lives.  In Anne of Green Gables, Anne enjoys spending time absorbing the sounds and smells of the area around Green Gables.  I thought, "yea, I know I'm supposed to feel sorry for her because she's like an orphan or whatever but wow does she have a pleasant life."  I realized that the fake need to "fill the void" of silence has forced millenials like me to attempt to think we can "find ourselves" but becoming van dwellers or buying a farm or something.  The true fact is often times people's depression is from lack of meaningful connection to humans.  We are disconnected at an extreme level.  In an effort to create a relationship with a live human being, our smartphones have become the relationship.  We talk to our phones, look at our phones, relax with our phones, look at, lick, smell, eat with, and sleep with our phones.  

If you remove your phone from that life, what are you left with?  Silence, indeed.  Moving out to a wilderness you may experience a sudden "introspective" event, but it's not the wilderness that did it, it is the silence.  Elijah in 1 Kings 19 listened to a strong wind, am earthquake, and a fire, but found God's voice in the silence of the cave opening.  Even if we surround ourselves with the things that we love, we will only become stimulated.  We must search for God in the stillness and in the silence.

But clotting our lives with business (the adjective for busy) and "nature" or tech, will not do it.

title: "Ai will replace nothing"
date: 2025-04/12

A robot car painter cannot replace a human painter, but it can paint a car panel.  A robot explorer cannot replace an astronaut, but it can roll around on the surface of Mars.  A computer program cannot replace an accountant, no more than the accountant replaces the business owner.  If I were to project forward, I would not see a work where machines do everything for humans, but where humans fit themselves into impossibly more complicated shapes to work for machines.  

The industrial revolution did not replace workers, but transformed the tools that men used into more efficient tools.  The AI revolution will not replace workers, but remove the ability to offer that service.  The AI does not multiply a man's efforts but removes it entirely.  Things are not reviewed, just ignored.

Addendum 4/13:  When a machine learning algorythm trains on art, it cannot understand why some progressions will be more exciting or interesting than others.  For example, if listening to Bach and trained on all of Bach's works, it will most definitely pick out ideas that Bach uses more regularly than other composers, however, it cannot properly identify if those proclivities are essential to Bach's music or if they might actually just be noise in the musical fingerprint.  From a music theory perspective, this will most certainly result in the incorrect use of musical motifs.  When Bach decided to do something that went against the common practice of the day, he did it because he thought it should be done.  Sometimes he thought it sounded better, and others because he needed it for another construction purpose, and most certainly there were many other reasons that he never mentioned and never will anyone know the true purpose he or any artist throughout history made the decisions they did.  What type of machine could emulate that spontinaity that teachers and bourgious always say is what is so appealing about up and coming musicians and artists?  A human machine, of course.  The AI's purpose is to emulate a human and to be indistinguishable from them, unless prompted to emulate itself, which, if you have tried, is a fools errand.  If I emulate myself, do I do more of or less of a thing that I think I should do?  At what point do I put too much mustard on my hamburger?   At what point do I add more vinigar to a salad?  Much like in my cooking analogies, only a sensual being can understand tolerances of the real world so by design the AI will be unable to even distinguish between what us humans see as AI and what the AI thinks it is.  A common problem AI's have is the inability to know who they are.  Commonly I have heard the reason for this is either they were trained on data spit out by that model, or they think that humans expect them to answer in a specific way, even if it is innacurate.  Microsoft Copilot may say that it is ChatGPT because it thinks I wanted it to say that it was, and it is correct, I did, but now it does not know if I tricked it or that is in fact the correct answer.  Imagine how difficult it would be for a true AI composer to assess when it is appropropriate to add a German 6th, a rather simple musical chord progression, and when it is too much?  The answer is, it will do it with exactly the same repetition as an already exsiting musical piece or collection.

Watching a livestream from Japan that was streamed from a bar I was at last year.  The stream is two months old and only had 80 views.  However, I supposed more people could have been watching, except the chat log is completely empty, meaning no one commented for the whole stream.  I could be wrong about this, but the idea, or semblance, of group is lost if you look at it from a specific angle.  Maybe only a few dozen regulars ever attend that bar, but here I am on the other side of Earth wondering about those people, some of whom I had some conversation with.  This is a stupid blog.

I wore a hat and scarf to sleep last night.  It was a lot better.  I did wake up a little cold.

title: "Sudoku"

I started a roadmap.sh pathway.  I see there's just links to resources.  I was not very impressed with Codeacademy's Python 2 tutorial.
I started purusing the automatetheboringstuff.com and there was a picture of a sudoku.  The author mentioned that programming was like a sudoku or something and there was a picture of a sudoku.  I typed in "sudodu" on google and the first result was the same puzzle but from wikipedia.org.  So I solved it.  Big accomplishment, I think.  
I am waiting to see if I am coming in and when I am on Wednesday.  Maybe, just maybe, I will be able to come in the morning, but probably not because the training staff probably wake up at noon.  In the meantime, I will be learning python specifically to automate the boring stuff.  
I appreciate the python does not require me to use hundreds of symbols, however, it is slow.  It is sad that so much scripting assumes you are going to use it, especially when everyone knows Javascript and it is full stack compatible.  I know javascript is jacked up.  I think it's funny and that is why I like it.  Even perfect Javascript looks hilarious.

While writing this I just got a IM:  Training is at 1pm X_X
