title: "Sudoku"

I started a roadmap.sh pathway.  I see there's just links to resources.  I was not very impressed with Codeacademy's Python 2 tutorial.
I started purusing the automatetheboringstuff.com and there was a picture of a sudoku.  The author mentioned that programming was like a sudoku or something and there was a picture of a sudoku.  I typed in "sudodu" on google and the first result was the same puzzle but from wikipedia.org.  So I solved it.  Big accomplishment, I think.  
I am waiting to see if I am coming in and when I am on Wednesday.  Maybe, just maybe, I will be able to come in the morning, but probably not because the training staff probably wake up at noon.  In the meantime, I will be learning python specifically to automate the boring stuff.  
I appreciate the python does not require me to use hundreds of symbols, however, it is slow.  It is sad that so much scripting assumes you are going to use it, especially when everyone knows Javascript and it is full stack compatible.  I know javascript is jacked up.  I think it's funny and that is why I like it.  Even perfect Javascript looks hilarious.

While writing this I just got a IM:  Training is at 1pm X_X
