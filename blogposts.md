title: "Ai will replace nothing"
date: 2025-03

A robot car painter cannot replace a human painter, but it can paint a car panel.  A robot explorer cannot replace an astronaut, but it can roll around on the surface of Mars.  A computer program cannot replace an accountant, no more than the accountant replaces the business owner.  If I were to project forward, I would not see a work where machines do everything for humans, but where humans fit themselves into impossibly more complicated shapes to work for machines.  

The industrial revolution did not replace workers, but transformed the tools that men used into more efficient tools.  The AI revolution will not replace workers, but remove the ability to offer that service.  The AI does not multiply a man's efforts but removes it entirely.  Things are not reviewed, just ignored.

Watching a livestream from Japan that was streamed from a bar I was at last year.  The stream is two months old and only had 80 views.  However, I supposed more people could have been watching, except the chat log is completely empty, meaning no one commented for the whole stream.  I could be wrong about this, but the idea, or semblance, of group is lost if you look at it from a specific angle.  Maybe only a few dozen regulars ever attend that bar, but here I am on the other side of Earth wondering about those people, some of whom I had some conversation with.  This is a stupid blog.

I wore a hat and scarf to sleep last night.  It was a lot better.  I did wake up a little cold.

I started a roadmap.sh pathway.  I see there's just links to resources.  I was not very impressed with Codeacademy's Python 2 tutorial.
I started purusing the automatetheboringstuff.com and there was a picture of a sudoku.  The author mentioned that programming was like a sudoku or something and there was a picture of a sudoku.  I typed in "sudodu" on google and the first result was the same puzzle but from wikipedia.org.  So I solved it.  Big accomplishment, I think.  
I am waiting to see if I am coming in and when I am on Wednesday.  Maybe, just maybe, I will be able to come in the morning, but probably not because the training staff probably wake up at noon.  In the meantime, I will be learning python specifically to automate the boring stuff.  
I appreciate the python does not require me to use hundreds of symbols, however, it is slow.  It is sad that so much scripting assumes you are going to use it, especially when everyone knows Javascript and it is full stack compatible.  I know javascript is jacked up.  I think it's funny and that is why I like it.  Even perfect Javascript looks hilarious.

While writing this I just got a IM:  Training is at 1pm X_X
