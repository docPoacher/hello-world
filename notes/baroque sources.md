6. S. ANDREA AL QUIRINALE. By Gian Lorenzo Bernini. 1658-70. Rome. (Photograph: Anderson)
Commissioned by Cardinal Camillo Pamphili, nephew of Pope Innocent X. for the Jesuit novices on the Quirinal. The façade exhibits some similarities to that designed by Pietro da Cortona for S. Maria della Pace [153]. especially in the semicircular portico on free-standing columns and in the interplay of con- cave and convex forms. The oval plan is unusual in that the long axis lies parallel to the façade. For the interior see No. 154. Lit: R. Wittkower: Art and Architecture in Italy 1600-1750, rev. ed. 1973. 181-4: Hibbard.

8. THE DEATH OF THE VIRGIN. By Caravaggio, 1605-6. Oil on canvas, 369 x 245 cm. Paris, Louvre. (Photograph: Réunion des Musées Nationaux) Painted for a chapel in the Roman church of S. Maria della Scala but re- jected by the fathers as being too vulgar. Despite this clerical disapproval, Caravaggio's altarpiece was greatly admired by the painters in Rome and in 1607 was purchased by the Duke of Mantua, on the recommendation of no less an artist than Rubens. Lit: W. Friedlaender: Caravaggio Studies, 1955. 126-7, 195-8.

9. VENUS AND ADONIS. By Peter Paul Rubens, c. 1635. Oil on canvas, 197.2 x 241.6 cm. New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art (Gift of Harry Payne Bingham. 1937). (Photograph: Museum)

The painting depends, as Panofsky has shown (Problems in Titian. 1969. 154n.), on Titian's Leave-taking of Adonis in the Prado, of which Rubens had made a copy. Lit: J.-A. Goris and J. S. Held: Rubens in America, 1947. 38. 

10. SALT-CELLAR. By Georg Petel, c. 1627-8. Ivory, with silver-gilt base and salt receptacle. 44 cm. high. Stockholm, Royal Palace. (Photograph: Sven Nilsson)

11 . THE ARCADIAN SHEPHERDS. By Nicolas Poussin, c. 1640. Oil on canvas, 85 x 121 cm. Paris, Louvre. (Photograph: Réunion des Musées Nationaux)

The best exposition of the subject is by E. Panofsky, in Philosophy and History. Essays presented to Ernst Cassirer, 1936. 223-54 (see also his Meaning in the Visual Arts, 1955. 295-320). Panofsky points out that the painting presents a more classical and more 'philosophical interpretation of the theme of Et in Arcadia Ego than that seen in Poussin's earlier version of the subject now at Chatsworth. Whereas in the Chatsworth picture there is an element of surprise as the shepherds come unexpectedly upon the tomb, the Louvre canvas shows them absorbed in calm discussion and meditation on the idea of mortality. The dating of the picture is a matter of dispute: the arguments are sum- marized by Blunt (Poussin, 1966. 80-81), who would himself prefer to place

it as late as the 1650s. 

12. CARDINAL DE BOUILLON. By Hyacinthe Rigaud, 1708. Oil on canvas. 274 x 217 cm. Perpignan, Musée Rigaud. (Photograph: Lauros-Giraudon)

Part of the frieze that fills the coving of the frescoed vault of the Farnese Gallery: The mythological subject is treated as a framed picture flanked by decorative figures simulating statuary and by Michelangelesque ignudi in imitation of living persons.

According to Ovid's Metamorphoses (IV, 665-7). Perseus flew through the air with wings on his feet. Rubens (as Professor Rensselaer Lee informs me) follows the version of the fable told in the Moralized Ovid of Pierre Bersuire in

representing Perseus riding on Pegasus.

25. THE ALLOCUTION OF CONSTANTINE. By Peter Paul Rubens, 1622. Oil on panel. 46.4 x 56.5 cm. Philadelphia, John G. Johnson Collection. (Photograph: Museum)

An oil sketch for one of the Constantine tapestries designed by Rubens for Louis XIII of France. The artist seems to have sent to Paris the full-size cartoons rather than the original oil sketches. In any event, the Allocution was one of the first subjects to be submitted for approval. and Peiresc's frank report on it is contained in a letter to Rubens dated 1 December 1622 (see p. 47). The tapestry woven from this design is in the Mobilier National in Paris. Rubens follows the formula for the Allocation seen in the relief of Marcus Aurelius on the Arch of Constantine in Rome.

26. TRUTH UNVEILED. By Gian Lorenzo Bernini. 1646-52. Marble, 280 cm. high. Rome, Galleria Borghese. (Photograph: Alinari)

Bernini's original intention was to carve a large marble group of Time unveiling Truth. By 1652, when the Truth was already completed, the figure of Time had not even been begun, and the marble block lay still untouched in the master's house at the time of his death.

32. CHRIST OF CLEMENCY. By Juan Martinez Montañés , 1603-6. Polychrome wood, 190 cm. high. Seville, Cathedral. (Photograph: Mas) Commissioned on 5 April 1603 by Mateo Vázquez de Leca, archdeacon of

Carmona. The final payment to Montañés was made on 9 April 1606. In addition to showing the Saviour alive, and with eyes open 

[33], the Crucifix is unusual in having four nails instead of three. Although each foot is attached to the wood by a single nail, the legs are not parallel but are crossed one over the other. Montañés explained to Francisco Pacheco that he took this detail from the Revelations of St Bridget, who describes precisely how the Saviour was nailed to the cross.

34. THE canvas, 338 x 348 cm. Rome, S. Luigi dei Francesi, Contarelli Chapel. (Photo- graph: Alinari)

The decoration of the Contarelli chapel was Caravaggio's first monumental commission. He was to furnish three paintings an altarpiece showing St Matthew and the Angel, and two large laterals representing the Calling of St Matthew and his Martyrdom. The first altarpiece was found unsatisfactory, and a second version (still in situ) was accordingly painted by the artist. That the action of the Calling takes place out of doors and not, as has been suggested. in 'a downstairs room in the Palazzo del Monte', was established by W. Schöne: Über das Licht in der Malerei, 1954. 137-8. The contemporary dress worn by

Matthew and the tax-gatherers [Fig. 2] denotes their worldliness and greed

of gain. Lit: W. Friedlaender: Caravaggio Studies, 1955. 106-10, 178-9; G. A. Dell'Acqua and M. Cinotti: Il Caravaggio e le sue grandi opere da San Luigi del Francesi, 1971.

Figure 2. Detall of The Calling of St Matthew. c. 1598-1600. Caravaggio

One of the series of the Seven Sacraments painted between 1644 and 1648 for Paul Freart de Chantelou. Poussin had earlier painted a set of the Sacra- ments for his Roman patron Cassiano dal Pozzo and had been asked by Chan- telou to have copies made of them. In the end the artist decided to paint an entirely new series for Chantelou. Writing about this picture in a letter of 30 May 1644 to Chantelou, Poussin specifically mentions the Roman triclinium at which the apostles will be shown reclining.

The last work painted by Annibale Carracci in Bologna before leaving for Rome. Commissioned by the Confraternity of San Rocco in Reggio Emilia as early as 1587 or 1588, but executed for the most part in 1595. The painting became widely known through the etching made after it by Guido Reni. Fig. 4 shows a detail of the right-hand part of the picture.

59. THE MIRACLES OF ST FRANCIS XAVIER. By Peter Paul Rubens, 1616-17. Oil on canvas, 535 x 395 cm. Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum. (Photo- graph: Museum)

Commissioned, together with its companion piece, The Miracles of St Ignatius of Loyola, for the high altar of the Jesuits' church in Antwerp. Though Ignatius and Francis Xavier were not canonized until 1622, the altarpieces seem to have been completed no later than 1617. They remained in the church until the suppression of the Jesuit Order in 1773, after which they were removed to Vienna. Also in the Vienna Museum are the oil sketches, or modelli, for these compositions. Like the paupers in Carracci's St Roch, the afflicted persons crowd round Xavier's pedestal [Fig. 5].

Painted for Paul Fréart de Chantelou, to whom Poussin wrote in March 1639 to say that the picture was finished. As the artist indicated in his letter to Stella (see p. 86), the work was the first in which he made use of his method of expressing the passions. In the group at the left [61] Poussin represents 'une action de charité.

The group is composed according to a conven- tional scheme for 'regent pieces': the four governesses are seated at a table as if in conference, while a servant enters bearing a message. But in no other respect does Hals's painting resemble the neatly finished and unimaginative productions of the fashionable Dutch portraitists of his day.

    Jan Six (1618-1700) was an Amsterdam merchant and humanist whom Rembrandt had earlier portrayed in an etching of 1647. The date of the paint- ing is supplied by a chronogram composed by Six himself:

Gabriele Fonseca had been the personal physician of Pope Innocent X. Though Bernini must have begun the portrait before Fonseca's death in 1668, the style of the work shows it to have been executed for the most part in the 1670s. The bust is set in a niche to the left of the altar in the Fonseca Chapel of S. Lorenzo in Lucina, and the subject's gaze is directed to a painting of the

Annunciation above the altar. Lit: Wittkower, Bernini 256-7: Hibbard, Bernini. 217-18.

Painted for the church of S. Maria Nuova in Cortona, where it remained until it was purchased in the early eighteenth century by Prince Ferdinando de' Medici and taken to Palazzo Pitti. In its place Ferdinando commissioned a painting of the same subject by Giuseppe Maria Crespi. The little dog seen in Lanfranco's painting is specifically mentioned in the legend of St Margaret. There are two drawings for the work in the Louvre.

The church was begun in 1652 by Carlo Rainaldi for Pope Innocent X. Rainaldi's designs were not found acceptable, and in 1653 he was replaced by Borromini, who within the space of a few years transformed the project into something unmistakably his own. The façade is substantially the work of Borromini, though the towers were not built by him.

Natianted for the Parisian banker Pointel, who (as Félibien reports) wished the artist to produce as the so-chuld stival Guido Rent's Virgin Maished the Side of her Companions (the so-called Sewing Circle'). The work difter in the Aousin's other versions of this subject (e.g. that in the collection of Sir Pothony Blunt) in that Rebecca does not offer water to Eliezer and that the Janer's camels are not shown.

98. THE LOVESICK GIRL. By Jan Steen, c. 1660-68, Oil on canvas, 61 x 52.1 cm. Munich, Alte Pinakothek. (Photograph: Museum)

The subject exists in many versions by Steen. The letter held by the young woman bears the artist's signature and the inscription: Daar baat geen medesyn want het is minepyn (Medicine is of no avail if the pains are those of love). This theme is reinforced both by the Cupid and by the painting of two lovers over the bed. The doctor's costume shows him to be not a physician from real life but a stock character from the comedy stage; see on this subject S. J.

One of the few known flower-pieces by this gifted master of still life, who is chiefly remembered for his fish-pieces and sumptuous banquet tables. The fact that the bouquet includes flowers that bloom at different times indicates that Van Beyeren did not paint an actual bunch of flowers in a vase but worked up his composition from studies of individual blooms.

During the last years of his life, when he was at work on the Four Seasons, Poussin was afflicted by a trembling of the hands which made it increasingly difficult for him to practise his art. "They exhort me to have patience, he wrote to Chantelou in 1664. 'which is the remedy for all ills: I take it as a medicine which costs little but which also cures nothing.'

The scene records, by means of a quite preposterous allegory. the arrival of Henry IV in Lyons to meet his wife Maria, who had come from Italy to join him. There is an oil sketch of the subject, in grisaille, in Leningrad. A second Medici cycle, glorifying the life of Henry IV, was begun by Rubens but never completed.

The programme of decoration for the Oranjezaal was worked out in some detail by the architect Jacob van Campen, but Jordaens insisted on being given considerable freedom in devising his enormous Triumph. In 1652, when the work was finished, he sent to Amalia van Solms, the widow of Frederick Henry, an annotation' in French, explaining the iconography of the painting.

(Photograph: Archives Photographiques, Paris) The transformation of the modest hunting lodge built at Versailles by Louis XIII began in 1669, when Le Vau proceeded to envelop the garden side of the original structure in a new building. In 1678 Mansart filled in the central terrace overlooking the gardens in order to build the Galerie des Glaces and added

large wings on either side of the main block.

121. THE SUPPER AT EMMAUS. By Caravaggio, c. 1600. Oil on canvas. 139 x 195 cm. London. Trustees of The National Gallery. (Photograph: Museum) Bellori writes of this picture: 'In the Supper at Emmaus, besides the rustic forms of the two apostles, and of the Lord figured as young and beardless, the host waits at table with his cap on, and on the table there is a dish of grapes, figs and pomegranates, out of season.' (Le vite de' pittori, scultori et architetti moderni, 1672. 213.) The still life passage [Fig. 12] is particularly striking even if as Bellori complains, the fruit could not have been ripe so early in the year. The basket of fruit bears a marked resemblance to Caravaggio's painting in the Ambrosiana in Milan [38]. On the symbolism of the fruit in the London picture see D. T. Kinkead in Palatino, x. 1966. 114. Lit: W. Friedlaender: Caravaggio Studies, 1955. 164-7.

122. THE NIGHT WATCH. By Rembrandt. 1642. Oil on canvas, 359 × 438 cm. Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum. (Photograph: Museum) The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq has been known as

"The Night Watch' since the early nineteenth century. Baldinucci, whose Life of Rembrandt was published in 1686 and who took his information from a former pupil of Rembrandt, particularly mentions the spatial illusionism in the rendering of the two officers [123]: 'Among the figures [is] one with his foot raised in the act of marching and holding in his hand a halberd so well drawn in perspective that, though upon the picture surface it is no longer than half a yard, it yet appeared to everyone to be seen in its fuil length. (Comincia- mento e progresso dell'arte d'intagliare in rame colla vita de' piu eccellenti maestri della stessa professione, 1686). The canvas was cut down in the eighteenth century when it was moved from the hall of the civic-guard companies (the Kloveniersdoelen) to the Town Hall. An early copy of the work, attributed to Gerrit Lundens (London. National Gallery), shows the composition in its

original state. Lit: Rosenberg. Rembrandt. 138-43. 350-52; Bredius/Gerson. 584-5.

(Photograph: Alinari) A painting of the meeting of Pope Leo and Attila had been proposed for St Peter's some years earlier; but the Cavaliere d'Arpino, who was given the commission for the altarpiece, died before completing it. Algardi was com- missioned to execute the marble relief in 1645. The sculptor's full-scale model

in stucco is installed on the staircase of the Biblioteca Vallicelliana. Lit: J. Pope-Hennessy: Italian High Renaissance and Baroque Sculpture, 2nd ed. 1970. 448; R. Wittkower: Art and Architecture in Italy 1600-1750, rev.

Work on the frescoes began in 1647 but was interrupted for several years during which Cortona painted the Gallery in the Palazzo Pamphili in Piazza Navona. Despite the lapse of time between the decoration of the dome and that of the apse, the interdependence of the two zones proves that the frescoes were conceived as a unified composition from the start. For another view of the dome see illustration 163.

152. PALAZZO BARBERINI, FAÇADE. By Carlo Maderno, Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Francesco Borromini. 1628-33. Rome. (Photograph: Alinari)

The commission to remodel the original palace was given by Pope Urban VIII to Maderno, who was succeeded in 16.29 by Bernini. The feigned perspec- tive of the windows of the uppermost storey probably follows Maderno's design. Borromini's contribution to the project is difficult to determine. The neo-Baroque gateway is by Francesco Azzurri (1827-1901), probably c. 1880.

(Photograph: Alinari) The remodelling of the fifteenth-century church of S. Maria della Pace was ordered in 1656 by Pope Alexander VII. Cortona's design of the façade became enormously influential, the portico being imitated by Bernini at S. Andrea al Quirinale (6) and in London by Sir Christopher Wren on the transepts of St Paul's and by James Gibbs on the façade of St Mary-le-Strand.

154. 5. ANDREA AL QUIRINALE, INTERIOR. By Gian Lorenzo Bernini, 1658-70. Rome. (Photograph: Alinari)

The predominance of the altar in this richly decorated interior is assured by the unexpectedly short distance between the entrance and the apsidal chapel and by the light that falls upon it from a concealed source. In addition, the transverse axis terminates in pilasters rather than in open chapels, with the

result that the eye of the spectator, glancing to left and right, is checked at these points and quickly returned to the altar chapel. The sculptured figure of St Andrew (carved by Antonio Raggi) soars upward from the painting of his martyrdom (the work of Guillaume Courtois) to the light of the heavenly dome where the dove of the Holy Spirit appears within the lantern. For the façade see illustration 6.

The Spanish Discalced Trinitarians commissioned Borromini to build the monastery of S. Carlo alle Quattro Fontane in 1634. The church itself was constructed in 1638-41. The façade, erected 1665-7. was Borromini's last work. Its fusion of architectural and sculptural elements and its rhythmic manipulation of surface make it one of the most imaginative creations of all Seicento architecture.

Panofsky: Studies in Iconology, 1939. 83) was copied by Salvator Rosa in his painting of Mr Altham as a Hermit, where it appears as a relief on a plinth (see R. W.

Although the book was not published until 1645. Rubens's design for the title-page was made no later than 1632, for it was in that year that Cornelis Galle received payment for the engraving. The volume contains an explanatory note on the meaning of the title-page, which was very probably written by Caspar Gevartius.

Richelieu commissioned two paintings for the decoration of the Grand Cabinet in the Palais Cardinala Moses and the Burning Bush to be hung over the fireplace (now in Copenhagen) and Time rescuing Truth for the ceiling. The illusionism and pronounced foreshortening of the latter are unique in the work of Poussin. The artist painted another Time rescuing Truth, which has been lost: but copies show it to have been utterly different from the Richelieu ceiling.

Commissioned in September 1600 by Tiberio Cerasi for the decoration of his chapel in S. Maria del Popolo. Caravaggio was to furnish two paintings on cypress wood representing the Conversion of St Paul and the Crucifixion of St Peter for the lateral walls. Final payment was made to the artist in November 1601. Both paintings in the Cerasi chapel are on canvas, a fact that has led some scholars to speculate whether the panel with the Conversion of St. Paul in the Odescalchi-Balbi collection might not be Caravaggio's first solution for this subject. later replaced by the present picture. Over the altar of the Cerasi chapel is Annibale Carracci's Assumption of the Virgin.

bronze and stucco. Rome, St Wittkower has said of the Cathedra Petri that it 'signifies in every respect the climax of Bernini's career'. The evolution of this complex project, which began in 1656 with the decision to move the chair of St Peter from the Baptismal Chapel to the apse of the basilica, can be followed through docu- ments and through Bernini's own drawings and bozzetti. The relic was placed in the Cathedra and the great work unveiled in January 1666.

Sent as a gift by the artist to Constantijn Huygens, who as secretary of the Prince of Orange had obtained for him the commission to paint a series of pictures of the Passion of Christ. In a letter of 27 January 1639 accompanying the painting Rembrandt advised Huygens to hang the work in a strong light so that it could be seen at its best. Copies of the painting show that it was

originally somewhat larger than it is today. Lit: H. Gerson: Seven Letters by Rembrandt, 1961. 50-54: Rosenberg. Rembrandt. 191-2; Bredius/Gerson. 598.

In 1667, by which time the work had been acquired by Louis XIV for the royal collection, it formed the subject of a lecture delivered by Sébastien Bourdon before the Royal Academy. Bourdon remarked

198. particularly on the significance of the light: Poussin, he said, 'a voulu figurer un matin, parce ce qu'il y a quelque apparence que Dieu choisit cette heure-là comme la plus belle et celle où les objets semblent plus gracieux, afin que ces nouveaux illuminės reçussent davantage de plaisir, en ouvrant les yeux, et que ce miracle fût plus manifeste et plus évident.

The work illustrates the nineteenth chapter of Matthew's Gospel. Episodes such as the woman carrying a child, the blind man guided by his wife, and the invalid lying on a wheelbarrow are reminiscent of Annibale Carracci's St Roch distributing Alms [58], which (as was noted by Münz) Rembrandt could have known through the print by Guido Reni. The detail reproduced here [Fig. 21] shows the shadow cast by the praying woman on Christ's garment. Princeton University, the Art Museum. (Photograph: Taylor & Dull, Inc.)

A preparatory oil sketch for the ceiling of the Salon d'Apollon at Versailles.

The chariot of Louis-Apollo is preceded by a putto signifying the morning star

and by Minerva, who puts Falsehood and Discord to flight. The Four Seasons

are distributed along the curving band of the zodiac. The ceiling painting as

finally executed shows some significant changes, which were probably dictated

by Le Brun: the effect of foreshortening is greatly moderated, as if to conform to the method of Guido Reni [177] rather than to that of Guercino [178]. The symbolism of the sun is followed out even in the carved decoration of the doors of the Salle de Vénus [115].

Jan Caspar Gevaerts (1593-1666), scholar and humanist, became Clerk of the City of Antwerp in 1621. An intimate friend of Rubens for almost twenty years, it was he who put the artist in touch with the French antiquarian Peiresc. The portrait was engraved by Paulus Pontius.

Girardon carved the figures of Apollo and the three nymphs in the fore- ground, the three at the back being the work of Regnaudin. The ewer held by one of the kneeling nymphs is decorated with a relief representing Louis XIV's crossing of the Rhine. The group was placed in the central niche of the Grotto of Thetis, see illustration 117. The Grotto was demolished in 1684 and in the late eighteenth century the sculptures were moved to a new setting designed by Hubert Robert.
